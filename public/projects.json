    "description": "For our exam project in Cloud Technologies at NTNU Gjøvik, we got to create a vCard parser in Python. This application is hosted on three different subsystems. The Frontend and Backend on Railway, and the Cache on Render. The idea is to upload a vcard file in frontend, parse it to json, send the json file to the cache, then the cache sends it further to the backend. The user are also able to download all json files from the backend database, but in vcard format. Therefore, when the user click on the 'download' button, the cache get the json file from the backend, parses it back to vcard, and then sends it to the frontend. This project uses Flask API for the backend and cache.",
